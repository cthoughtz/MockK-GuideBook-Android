Coroutines and suspend functions

As MockK uses function literals to create stubs, small changes are needed to stub suspend functions.
MockK provides functions prefixed with [co] as equivalents to other functions, such as [coEvery] and
[coAnswers].

The full list of methods with coroutine equivalents:

1. coEvery
2. coJustRun
3. coVerify
4. coVerifyAll
5. coVerifyOrder
6. coVerifySequence
7. coExcludeRecords
8. coMatch
9. coMatchNullable
10. coWithArg
11. coWithNullableArg
12. coAnswers
13. coAndThen
14. coInvoke

Difference between order an sequence is that order just makes sure that the calls are called in a order while sequence makes sure
that the called in a order but not more then once. only in that sequence.

example:
order -> A B C A B C A B C (they are called inorder even though they repeat)
sequence -> A B C (The sequence breaks if A is called again because it is not apart of that sequence)
