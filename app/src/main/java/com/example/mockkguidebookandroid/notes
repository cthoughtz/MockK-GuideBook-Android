Top-level functions

Kotlin lets you write functions that don't belong to any class or object, called top-level functions.
These calls are translated to static methods in Java, and a special Java class is generated to hold
the functions. These top-level functions can be mocked using mockkStatic, but you need to figure out
the class name of this generated Java class.
