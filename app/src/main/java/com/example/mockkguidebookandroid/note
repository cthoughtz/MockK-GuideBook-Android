Most stubs will use [returns] to always return the same value when the corresponding method is called.
Sometimes, the method you're trying to mock may be more complicated and require a more advanced stub.

If you watn to change the resutl of a mocked method depending on its arguments, run additional code
whenever a method is called, or just print out "Hello world" when a mock is used, [answers] is the
tool you'll wanted use.

[answers] takes the place of [returns] after an [every] call. When using [returns], it should be
followed by a value to return. When using [answers], it should be followed by a lambda function that
is run when the mocked method is called.
